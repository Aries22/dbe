							<h2>CORPORATE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT (CPM)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Corporate Performance Management is the totality of the processes and systems that are required to measure and manage the performance of an organization. It focuses on ensuring that all the parts of the organization are working together optimally in order to consistently achieve the goal of the organization. In other words, the focus of Performance Management is RESULT. A well designed and implemented performance management system will shift attention away from behavior and activities towards results.
Tools for Performance Management
The tools for managing Corporate Performance are diverse and they can be combined.
