            <h2>DUE DILIGENCE AND CORPORATE REVIEW</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Due diligence is a process of thorough and objective examination that is undertaken before corporate entities enter into major transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, issuing new stock or other securities, project finance, securitization etc. One of the key objectives of due diligence is to minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the possibility of unknown liabilities or risks. The most obvious consequence of making a deal without conducting adequate due diligence is a significant loss of value right after the deal’s announcement - that’s the bad news. The good news is that adequate due diligence can help avoid problems. When you have done your homework, you can uncover capability gaps, points of friction, and differences in decision making with the merged or acquired entity. Most importantly, you can make the critical business decisions, correctly. Whether you’re acquiring or being acquired, our due diligence team helps your decision process. We use a comprehensive and best practice checklist to ensure that all relevant areas are reviewed for completeness.
